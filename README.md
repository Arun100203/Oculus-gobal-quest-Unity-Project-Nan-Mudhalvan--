Rajkumar sir and Surya sir give an Extraordinary Introduction about AR-VR, we learnt about Blender and Unity.

Special Thanks to Rajkumar sir and Surya sir ðŸ¤©âœ¨ðŸ˜‡

I worked on a Unity project for the Nan Mudhalvan course, which included a room with a fan. When we entered the room, the fan rotated automatically.
